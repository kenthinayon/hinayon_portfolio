Kent Hinayon’s portfolio, built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) (App Router), TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Customize Your Content

- Hero statement + sections live in `app/page.tsx`
- Update your “Big Three” projects in the `projects` array
- Update “Currently Learning” in the `currentlyLearning` array
- Replace placeholder links (`#`) and the placeholder email (`your.email@example.com`)

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
